My name is Cody Cadena, I'm a passionate and skilled software developer with a background in full-stack development and computer science. Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to hone my abilities through academic studies at institutions like Blinn College and the University of North Texas, as well as hands-on, project-based learning in a software engineering bootcamp. Now, I’m excited to take the next step in my career.
I’ve developed a strong foundation in software engineering, including web development with the MERN stack, as well as computer science fundamentals like object-oriented programming, data abstraction, polymorphism, and SOLID principles. Beyond that, I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can put my problem-solving skills to use—whether it’s through creating applications that improve lives, like my AERD Diet app, or streamlining processes to make workflows more efficient, like I did at MDC Inc.
While my primary focus is on software development, I'm open to any IT or technology-related roles where I can bring my passion for making things better to the table. From improving customer experiences at La Quinta Inn & Suites to crafting solutions that benefit users in real-time, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality results in every role I take on.
If you're looking for someone who brings energy, accountability, and a dedication to driving positive outcomes, I’d love to connect. Please feel free to reach out!</div>
